Add complete information (coordinates, ratings, hours, descriptions) for tourist spots:

### Churches

## 2. Data Format Required

Each place should have the following structure:

```javascript
{
  title: "Place Name",
  type: "Category",
  timeRange: "HH:MM AM/PM - HH:MM AM/PM" or "Open 24 hours",
  rating: 4.5, // out of 5.0
  description: "Brief description",
  latitude: 18.1978, // decimal degrees
  longitude: 120.5956, // decimal degrees
  image: "/path/to/image.jpg (Jeiwinfrey nalang gagawa for all images)"
}
```

To get rating, just search the place name, then copy what's shown first
